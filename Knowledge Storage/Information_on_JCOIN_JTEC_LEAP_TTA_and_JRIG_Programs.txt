# What is JCOIN?

## What is JCOIN - The Research Need

Many people with opioid use disorder pass through the criminal justice system. Improved access to high-quality, evidence-based addiction treatment in justice settings is critical to addressing the opioid crisis.

## About the JCOIN Program

This program studies approaches to increase high-quality care for people in justice settings with opioid misuse or opioid use disorder. The research tests strategies to expand effective treatment and care in partnership with local and state justice systems and community-based treatment providers.

The program generates real-world evidence through a range of research approaches including implementation research, national surveys, and novel use of existing data. The program also provides opportunities for HEAL grantees to study the impacts of emerging policies and programs, and it introduces new and underrepresented investigators in justice-related research.

## About the JCOIN Coordination and Translation Center (CTC)

The Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) re-envisions how the justice system responds to addiction. The JCOIN Coordination and Translation Center (CTC) (PI: Faye Taxman, Ph.D., George Mason University) supports this crucial initiative through engaging with key stakeholders, disseminating products and findings, and providing infrastructure.

## JCOIN Vision

Every justice-involved individual with a substance use disorder should have timely access to evidence-based practices and treatment(s), whether the individual is detained or residing in the community.

# What is JTEC?

A free educational platform for criminal legal and health professionals.

Presented by the CTC, the JCOIN Training & Engagement Center (JTEC) brings together content from experienced researchers and practitioners, as well as people with lived experience in the justice and health systems, to allow users to expand knowledge, build skills, and facilitate improved research, practices, and treatments in criminal justice and healthcare.

## About JTEC Courses

Courses allow users to build knowledge on different topics while going at their own pace and without leaving the house or office. Join researchers and experts like Dr. David Farabee, as well as people with lived experience in the justice and health systems, to take a deep dive into topics that are relevant to people who work in or are impacted by the justice and health systems. These courses can take anywhere from 40 minutes to several hours to complete. Many will include quizzes or other opportunities to test your new knowledge. Start and stop these courses when it fits your schedule. You will receive a certificate when you complete the courses.

# What is LEAP?

## LEAP - Learning Experiences to Advance Practice

The Learning Experiences to Advance Practice (LEAP) program is an innovative platform for learning about conducting research in criminal justice and health settings.

The LEAP program includes the LEAP Learner Track, which includes six entry-level courses and resources on critical topics. By teaching about the effective and ethical conduct of research with criminal justice-involved populations, we hope to build capacity for this research, which is sorely needed.

More information about LEAP is available at: https://www.jcoinctc.org/leap

## LEAP Investigators and Scholars Program

The Capacity Building Core, which is part of JCOINâ€™s Coordination and Translation Center (CTC), has launched the Learning Experiences to Advance Practice (LEAP) education program to support investigators and scholars with training and knowledge to conduct research and build research capacity within justice and health settings.

### Goals of the LEAP Program

- **Grow the Research Workforce:** Equip individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to conduct ethical, rigorous research, including partnering with justice and health agencies, recruitment and enrollment of subjects, use of informed consents, and problem-solving in a variety of health, community, and justice settings.

- **Enlist Community Leaders:** Engage an array of community, health, and justice leaders to value and implement research findings in practice and to participate in collaborative research teams.

- **Motivate Learners:** Encourage learners to champion the completion of research projects and maintain fidelity to planned projects despite operational challenges.

- **Expand Research Pipeline:** Develop a pipeline of independent criminal justice and health researchers who can work in multidisciplinary teams.

### LEAP Program Tracks

#### LEAP Investigator Track

The Investigator track is designed for individuals interested in a career as an independent investigator and focuses on a project to be designed and carried out over two years. This track emphasizes research proposal writing, grant management, mentorship, and advanced research skills needed to be successful in criminal justice settings.

#### LEAP Scholar Track

The Scholar track supports clinicians, criminologists, and analysts interested in collaborating on research in justice settings. This one-year program focuses on the conduct of research in justice settings, formulating research questions, understanding elements of research design, ethical issues concerning research in justice settings, and collaborator roles to ground and translate the conduct of research.

# What is JCOIN Training and Technical Assistance (TTA)?

## Enhancing Justice and Behavioral Health Outcomes

Through learning opportunities and other forms of assistance, the JCOIN Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) program supports local and state justice and behavioral health agencies and stakeholders in integrating research and practice. Here you will find tailored resources and formats, including virtual learning and training opportunities, customized assistance and assessments, and other online resources.

JCOIN provides free training and technical assistance to support community-based organizations in developing strategies to improve substance use disorder (SUD) treatment delivery and to facilitate practitioner and researcher partnerships. This support elevates research and evaluation in a variety of justice and health settings.

More information about TTA is available at: https://www.jcoinctc.org/tta

## How JCOIN TTA Supports Communities

The organization is dedicated to enhancing the interface between research and practical application, particularly in the management of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) within justice and health systems. By developing strategic partnerships between practitioners and researchers, it ensures that evidence-informed research seamlessly integrates into daily practices. This effort includes the creation of a cascade of care model that accurately measures the handling of SUDs, accompanied by comprehensive strategic planning and advisory services to refine and guide these processes.

To address local needs effectively, the organization tailors Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) resources through customized needs assessments, ensuring that strategies are both relevant and impactful. This includes assessing treatment requirements and identifying service delivery gaps. The organization supports the implementation of these strategies by developing research-based solutions, facilitating peer-to-peer learning, and providing strategic planning for data collection. Moreover, it conducts evaluations of the strategies implemented to ensure they meet the intended goals and provide substantial benefits to the communities served.

# What is J-RIG (JCOIN Rapid Innovation Grants)?

## About J-RIG

The JCOIN Rapid Innovation Grant (J-RIG) program is a rapid funding mechanism designed to support small research grants to study newly emerging policies, practices, or interventions that address prevention and treatment of addiction in criminal legal settings.

Applications should focus on substances associated with overdose and overdose mortality. Projects should have direct relevance to individuals who are involved in the criminal legal system but need not take place within criminal legal settings.

J-RIG is intended to facilitate short-term projects that are not compatible with traditional National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding mechanisms for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, time sensitivity or pilot data collection. During its initial five years, J-RIG funded 13 small grants for a total of $1.4M across 8 funding cycles.

More information about J-RIG is available at: https://www.jcoinctc.org/resources/j-rig/

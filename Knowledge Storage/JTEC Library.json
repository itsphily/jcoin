Assisting these individuals to connect with evidence-based treatment is an important health and safety goal.  Many justice professionals may recognize the need, but they may tend to consider treatment a goal of behavioral health agencies.  Having greater understanding of SUD and COD, as well as evidence-based and informed practices, is critical to developing coordinated criminal justice and behavioral health partnerships to improve client level outcomes. This course provides foundational knowledge about SUD and COD, reviews evidence-based practices for addressing SUD and COD, and presents practical information and resources to enhance treatment access and delivery.",

Dr. Watson discussed the issues related to implementation of harm reduction principles within Housing First programs and highlight possible implications for residents who are involved in the criminal justice system.  Joining Dr. Watson was Ed Stellon of Heartland Alliance and Dr. Carrie Pettus of Justice System Partners. Mr. Stellon is the Executive Director of Heartland Alliance, and has worked with Dr. Watson in the past to address implementation strategies for evidence-based practices related to housing first models. He shared his insights from the lens of a practitioner who has overseen various treatment programs, homeless service systems and has cultivated extensive knowledge in these areas by working with the substance use and mental health disorder population. Dr. Pettus discussed findings from her new report \u201cHousing Stability after Incarceration,\u201d which draws on interview data from a series of people two weeks, eight months, and 14 months post-release. The report centers housing as a key social determinant in successful reentry to understand how to focus resources on those most in need.",

In Course 4, system actors think about the lessons learned through integrating professional peers into drug treatment courts. This course entails three objectives.      Objective 1 is to give system actors knowledge about burnout and other challenges that professional peers may experience.     Objective 2 is to familiarize system actors with ways to address this burnout and to promote continued self-care so that professional peers can manage crisis.     Objective 3 is a familiarity with the recovery process of professional peers.",

            "Content": "Despite the evidence that providing medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD; i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) at the point of incarceration and during reentry reduce the risk of overdose death, decrease recidivism rates, and improve the well-being of the individual, financial and administrative limitations in jail/prison healthcare often serve as barriers to this recommended first-line treatment for OUD. In fact, evidence indicates that more than 80% of incarcerated individuals with a history of OUD do not receive life-saving medications during their stay.     Fortunately, there has been a substantial increase in the number of jails and prisons offering MOUD in recent years. This trend can be attributed to both the initiative of individual facilities and state legislation mandating the provision of MOUD. However, the resources and associated costs required to implement MOUD programs in jails and prisons can vary widely depending on the availability of services and the chosen delivery model.     With support from NIDA\u2019s Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN), researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine developed a customizable budget impact tool to assist jails and prisons with identifying an optimal MOUD delivery model, based on existing resources, and the costs that would be required to implement and sustain the model at their facility.     The tool captures critical nuances of the individualized budgeting process and accompanying tradeoffs faced by decision-makers of carceral settings who are interested in offering MOUD. For example, facilities may be looking to offer pharmacotherapy for the first time or expand a current model, such as offering extended-release naltrexone upon release from incarceration only. Moreover, MOUD delivery can be done by the facility\u2019s healthcare team, on-site vendor, or both. Alternatively, facilities may transport patients to an off-site treatment provider.     The budget impact tool, which was already being used by a number of carceral facilities, is now publicly available and paired with an open-access, peer-reviewed manuscript that serves as a user-friendly guide.",

To address access and standard of care disparities, addiction treatment and recovery support providers can engage in self-exploration regarding our own readiness for change in the implementation of practices that promote equity, justice, diversity, inclusion, and belonging in the addiction treatment industry.  Presenters will discuss the NAATP Diversity, Equity, Inclusivity & Belonging (DEIB) Advisory Committee\u2019s stages of change model for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. Just as treatment providers apply the Stages of Change Model in their work with patients, this model can help leaders chart a path to incorporating and using DEIB best practices in their work. This free webinar is sponsored by the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), in partnership with the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers (NAATP), and Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC).",

Transitioning to the community following incarceration is a particularly high-risk period for overdose death, especially during the first few weeks of release. Jails and prisons can play a pivotal role in addressing the opioid overdose epidemic by providing medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) during incarceration and services for the continuation of MOUD at community re-entry, which has shown to be effective in the continued use of MOUD after release and reductions in the risk of overdose death and recidivism.     This webinar will present recent findings from the Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) Clinical Research Center on the implementation and outcomes of a state law to expand the use of all three FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in seven county jails across the state. Panelists will discuss the benefits of implementing MOUD programs in correctional facilities, including the impact MOUD has had on reducing recidivism rates. Panelists will also discuss promising practices in program design to help limit medication diversion and provide guidance for correctional professionals and lawmakers as they consider implementing MOUD treatment in jails and prisons.",

Determining the best practices involves considering the necessary training, resources, and technical assistance for providing MOUD. In response to this urgent need, researchers with JCOIN\u2019s Clinical Research Center at Chestnut Health Systems conducted a national study to understand the OUD best practices in jails located in counties heavily impacted by opioid overdose in the U.S. and their resource and training needs.  This webinar presented findings from the national study, including the identification of 10 OUD best practices that were consistently referenced in treatment and practice guidelines recommended by a variety of federal agencies and national organizations, and were grounded in the scientific literature. Presenters also shared insights from study sites on critical barriers that impede the implementation and expansion of MOUD in the criminal legal system and facilitators to support and provide evidence-based services to individuals with OUD who come in contact with the legal system.",

Under the updated final rules of 42 CFR Part 8, jails and prisons may register as a hospital or clinic. Jails/prisons may stock and dispense methadone to treat OUD and manage acute opioid withdrawal syndrome.  This webinar provided an overview of the updated final rules of 42 CFR Part 8 and how they affect methadone dispensation in carceral settings. Speakers discussed the:      Process for how carceral settings can use the updated SAMHSA rule to increase methadone access;     Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s (DEA) regulations around dispensing methadone and buprenorphine;     Role of state regulations for accessing MOUD; and     Considerations for carceral settings when establishing a methadone dispensing program.",
